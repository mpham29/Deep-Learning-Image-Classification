# Deep-Learning-Image-Classification
Transfer learning on EfficientNet for image classification of cars

Goal: Build a model that can classify cars based on an image using deep learning methods.

The data used is from the Standford Car Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jutrera/stanford-car-dataset-by-classes-folder.

  Data is 16,185 images classified into 196 classes of cars with a 50:50 split of training and testing data.
