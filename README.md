# Deep-Learning-Image-Classification
Author: Mark Pham
Transfer learning on EfficientNet for image classification of cars

Goal: Build a model that can classify cars based on an image using deep learning methods.

The data used is from the Standford Car Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jutrera/stanford-car-dataset-by-classes-folder.

Data is 16,185 images classified into 196 classes of cars with a 50:50 split of training and testing data.

Adjusted batch size, changed amount of epochs, randomized data augmentations, froze layers of the model, added different layers, tried different learning rates, and experimented with different pre-trained models such as VGG-16 and MobileNet to maximize the accuracy of the model.
